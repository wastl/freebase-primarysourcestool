# REST API

## Get Entity by QID

The following HTTP request retrieves an entity by Wikidata QID:

    GET /entities/<QID>
      
The service is modeled after the Wikidata REST API, but currently only supports retrieving data in JSON format.
    
Status Codes:

  * 200: entity found, returned as JSON
  * 404: entity not found
  * 500: server error


## Get Random Entity (by Topic)

The following HTTP request retrieves a random entity, optionally by topic. The selection procedure is
left to the backend and might be improved in the future based on user profile etc.

    GET /entities/any?topic=<TOPIC>&user=<WikidataUser>
      
Both topic and user are optional, in which case the backend selects a random unapproved entity.
    
Status Codes:

  * 200: entity found, returned as JSON
  * 404: entity not found
  * 500: server error

## Mark Entity as Approved

The following HTTP request marks an entity identified by a Wikidata QID as approved:

    POST /entities/<QID>?approved=true&user=<WikidataUser>
    
The WikidataUser passed as argument is used for tracking purposes only and stored in the database together with
the approval flag.
   
Status Codes:

  * 200: entity found and marked as approved by user <WikidataUser>
  * 409: entity found but was already marked as approved by another user
  * 500: server error
  
 
# Building and Installation

The REST application is implemented in C++ using the [CppCMS](http://cppcms.com/) framework. Building the
application requires that you first download and install both frameworks and their dependencies (follow 
instructions on CppCMS webpage).

## Build from Source

The sources tool uses cmake for building the server. Please use the following commands to create the binary.

    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    
## Start Server
    
The binary can be started both as a standalone application for testing and as FastCGI binary to use in
Apache or lighttpd. For testing purposes, simply start the server with the following command:
    
    $ cd build
    $ ./freebase_backend -c ../config.json    
    
You can now access the running system at http://localhost:8080 and issue REST requests, e.g.

    curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/entities/any

For deployment, please follow the instructions on the [CppCMS Webpage](http://cppcms.com/).
